        <h2>Welcome to the official portal of Abeda Inamdar Senior College</h2>
        <p>The M.C.E. Society is one of the oldest educational organizations of Pune and has done pioneering work in the field of education. Even though established in the year 1948, right up to 1988 , the 23 acres of Azam Campus which houses most of the institutions run by the M.C.E. Society had only 2 high schools and 2 Primary Schools. The establishment and development of educational institutions actually began in the year 1989 with the establishment of Äbeda Inamdar Junior College. Today the M.C.E. Society governs Twenty-One educational Institutions imparting education in the field of Law, Architecture, Pharmacy,Management, I.T, Dentistry, Education, Arts, Science Commerce and Computer Science at Azam Campus. It has further acquired land at various places in Pune and its process of growth continues.

            The M.C.E. Society’s President, Mr. P.A Inamdar has held this responsible position from 1983 till date. It is under the dynamic and visionary leadership of Mr. P.A. Inamdar, that MCE Society and Azam Campus grew in stature and gained recognition as a premier education hub.
            
            Abeda Inamdar Senior College of Arts Science and Commerce, affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University was established with a donation from Mrs. Abeda Inamdar. The College was established in the year 1991-92 with one division each of B.Sc and B.Com. The Arts faculty was added in the year 1992-93 and B.Sc Computer Science was started in the year 1998. In 2001 M.Sc Computer Science began followed by MSc. Analytical Chemistry in 2002. In the very next year, 2003, the college established the Post Graduate Centres in English and Commerce. The expansion of the college continued with the establishment of the Post Graduate Centres in Microbiology and Mathematics in 2004; BBA (CA), M.Sc Analytical Chemistry and Ph.D Research Centre in Chemistry in 2005; BBA and M.A. Sociology in 2006; M.A Urdu in 2010; PhD Research Centres in Commerce and English in 2011 and M.A in Economics and Political Science in 2014.
            
            The growth of the college was not just visible in increase in the number of courses but also in student strength. The college student strength has increased rapidly; from 100 in 1991-92, the year of establishment to 1,191 in the year 2000 to 4,685 in 2010 and 5,113 in the Academic Year 2016-17.
            
            The College featured in the merit list of the Savitribai Phule Pune University for the first time in the Academic year 2004-05, with our student Miss Mifrah Abid securing the University Gold medal for M.A English. Since then there has been no looking back and each year a number of our students have featured in the University merit list. It is indeed a matter of pride that more than 50 of our students have featured in the merit lists of the SPPU during the last 10 Academic Years.
            
            Since 2008 our college has consistently featured amongst the top five colleges of Pune City according to various surveys carried out and published in various issues of India Today. Issue dated 2nd June 2008, 25 th June 2009, 28 th June 1010, and 18th July 2011. It has also been recognized as an A grade College by NAAC, Bangalore. Another feather in the cap of achievement of our college is that we were awarded the Indira Gandhi National Level award for Best NSS Unit and Best NSS Program Officer by the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Government of India, in the year 2004.
            
            The year 2015-16 was celebrated by the College as its Silver Jubilee Year. The college has done some path breaking work in making education accessible to the minorities and weaker sections of society. Thus today at 25 years the College stands proudly amongst the leading educational institutes of Pune.</p>
